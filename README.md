Nowaday we see hate factors growing among people using social media, to curb that if you want your content to be filtered as per your choice, the SentiBot
helps you. Even we can have a look at what other people think about a particular product which you are planning to consume. For eg : If you want to be a customer of any edtech company, you can have a look at the opinions others are having about the product. Also if you want to sell your product you can get to know the scope of your product according to region.

Challenges we faced :
We tried to scrape and fetch data from Twitter using APIs , for which we had  to learn efficient methods to scrape the data as well as link with the GUI, for which 
intially we had some issues during the coding phase. Since our team is new to this hackathon concept, the UI team had to face some problems during the course of developing.
